_Physics Hypotheses and Their Experimental Journey_

This repository is dedicated to exploring and documenting some of my hypotheses in physics. Each hypothesis is accompanied by attempts to prove or disprove it, including theoretical reasoning, experiments, data analysis, and conclusions.

## Structure

- `hypotheses/` — Markdown files for each hypothesis, including background, statement, and references.
- `experiments/` — Records of experimental setups, results, and analysis.
- `data/` — Raw or processed data supporting experiments.
- `docs/` — Additional documentation, guides, or research notes.

## How to Contribute

1. Propose a new hypothesis by creating a Markdown file in `hypotheses/`.
2. Document your experiments and results in `experiments/`.
3. Share relevant data in `data/`.
4. Discuss improvements or questions via Issues or Discussions.

Feel free to fork, contribute, or start your own investigations!
